Going further in my Data Science Bootcamp , I continued with Seaborn , specifically the Caegorical Plots which included:

(a) Barplot : A barplot is basically used to aggregate the categorical data according to some methods and by default itâ€™s the mean.

(b) Countplot : A countplot  is used to show the counts of observations in each categorical bin using bars.

(c) Violinplot : Violin Plot is a method to visualize the distribution of numerical data of different variables. It is similar to Box Plot but with a rotated plot on each side, giving more information about the density estimate on the y-axis .

(d) Stripplot

(e) Swarmplot

(f) Factorplot / Catplot
