Continuing with my Data Science project :

I did NumPy Excercises

Then I came on Pandas and did it's excercise:
Let's see some of its basics :

labels = ['a','b','c']
my_list = [10,20,30]
arr = np.array([10,20,30])
d = {'a':10,'b':20,'c':30}

pd.Series(data=my_list)
0    10
1    20
2    30
dtype: int64

pd.Series(my_list,labels)

a    10
b    20
c    30
dtype: int64

pd.Series(arr)
0    10
1    20
2    30
dtype: int64

pd.Series(arr,labels)
a    10
b    20
c    30
dtype: int64

DATA IN A SERIES

A pandas Series can hold a variety of object types:

pd.Series(data=labels)
0    a
1    b
2    c
dtype: object

AND SIMILARLY USING INDEX

Other than this , I did Data Frames Section too and its problems.
