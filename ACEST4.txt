ML 

So , Today I also learned about:
 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 
Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks, consists of input and output layers, as well as a hidden layer consisting of units that transform the input into something that the output layer can use. They perform very well in tasks that require to find patterns.

Deep Neural Network (DNN) 
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where multiple layers of neural networks are stacked to create a huge network to map input into the output. It allows the network to extract different features until it can recognize what it is looking for.

Linear regression
Linear regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. One example of a task where linear regression can be used is forecasting housing price based on past values.


K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.
The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other.


This 4 topics are just the summary of what I read.
