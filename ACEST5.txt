Program to sort array elements in Ascending Order in C++

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	//array declaration
	int arr[MAX];
	int n,i,j;
	int temp;
	
	//read total number of elements to read
	cout<<"Enter total number of elements to read: ";

	//check bound
	if(n<0 || n>MAX)
	{

	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	{

Training and testing machine learning with some example dataset.
So it was a machine learning practical where we have to give inputs from our system . For ex. I want to compare dogs and cats , so I give the system different types of images including the specific exceptions , the program had around 85% of accuracy , which was good. I also learnt about the concept that why and how we have to  give the system 4/5 of datasets as examples or preset and use the rest 1/5 for testing .
