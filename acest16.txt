Getting forward in my Data Science Bootcamp , I solved few problems related to MatPlotlib and I started with Seaborn :

First topic was distribution plots , which is a huge topic in itslef . Summarizing the plots I saw were:

(a) Distplot : Basic histogram type data
(b) Jointplot : Small dots like cells representing data on different axes
(c) Jointplot with hexagon like cells in kind parameter
(d) Jointplot with regression line
(e) Pairplot : To plot multiple pairwise bivariate distributions in a dataset
(f) Pairplot with hue which creates difference between the two choices
(g) Rugplot : Draw dashes for every point

I also learnt about Normal Distribution and Gaussian Distribution.

Seaborne is still on .
