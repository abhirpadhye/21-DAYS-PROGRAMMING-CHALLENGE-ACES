ML

I learnt the basic theory of Data Representation and Data Features . In Data Representation I learnt about a Bit , A bit is an abstract representation that can represent any duality, any binary distinction between two things. Like anything on a computer, it's this abstraction that gives it its power and a lot more . After this there were Bytes and Numbers and then Other types of data.

After this I learnt about the Data Features which is a huge topic in itslef which included Introduction to Data Features and Neural Networks . Then I attempted a quiz related to it. All of this was done in the Coursera's Machine Learning for All corse. 

DSA

I learnt about Vectors and different functions in its STL library , like sort(),find() etc.I
I also saw some DSA videos whose questions i will be doing tommorow.
I also solved a Hackerrank problem of vectors whose solution is below:


#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>


using namespace std;
int main(){
   int n,q;
   int index,value,col,size;
   
   cin>>n>>q;
   vector<int> mainwala[n]; 

   for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
       cin>>size;
        
        for(int j=0;j<size;i++){
            cin>>value;
            mainwala[i].push_back(value);
        }

   }

   for(int k=0;k<q;k++){
       cin>>col>>index;
       cout<<mainwala[col][index];
   }
   
   
  
return 0;
}
